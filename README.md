#SAQ.COM Analysis, Why & how to fix it.

## Prologue


There are some things in this world you have no choice to lives with, for us people from the Quebec province, the SAQ is one of those. You see in Quebec selling alchool is illegal for normal citizen, only the government can do that. As you can guess, since they are the only one selling imported wines and hard liquors, they have all the market, meaning they don't have to care, you will buy their product either way, garanteed.

Just to put you in context, they pocketed in 2011 1 billion (you heard that right) in profit. You would think that with that money they would hav a decent website... Well you would have guessed wrong, saq.com is a combination of bad user interaction, bad design, and refreshed sections that looks ok but does not fit with the overral design.


### How did we got there?

While the SAQ is public and we even have access to their annual reports, I can only guess what is hapenning internally that make them so change resistant. But like any big organization (more than 5000 employes) changes is slow, I can certainly picture the endless lines of directors, project managers & vice presidents meetings just to change a wording on the website.

It is also mind boggling that a company that probably got a graphic norms book of more than 100 pages got content like (this page)[http://www.saq.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogSearchResultView?searchType=700&viewTaskName=NouvelArrivageResultView&langId=-2&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001] that are totally off their general brand (maybe in that case lapresse paid for it since it match their branding better than the one from SAQ.)

Their website is surpringinly nothing like their brick and mortar store. There they innovate a lot faster implementing new concepts each year. When you enter an SAQ store you feel nothing like entering a creppy place, it is always hip and cool.

SAQ also introduced in 2009 the taster profile. Basically it revolve around wine types associated to a color that they stick on the bottle.Nothing too fancy, still the promotion worked and sold 14% more wine initialy compared to other compaigns they did. Profiles are illustrated below (french sorry).

### They also got it right elsewhere

They "recently" lanched an iPhone and Android native application, it si pretty good with food matching suggestions.

### Let's dive in

I divided this guide in each important section where I think the website is severely lacking clarity and good user experience, by importance order.



## Search functionnality

The SAQ seach is certainly a weird one, it is comprised of one search field with 5 different select tp help you categorise your search. Ont thing will probably jump right in the face. Not only the select look downright weird and unaligned, they also do not have the expected behavior. Once you popup that select option you will be greeted by a weird javascript popover. I can see why they needed that drilled down functionality but not like this.
